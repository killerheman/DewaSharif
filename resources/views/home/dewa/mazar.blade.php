        <h4>2. Entrance and Courtyard:</h4>
        <i>
            <h5> Main Gateway (Darwaza) :</h5>
        </i>
        The entrance to the Mazar is through a grand gateway, reflecting the blend of Mughal and Indian architectural
        styles. The gateway is decorated with traditional arch designs, detailed carvings, and inscriptions.
        The entrance is flanked by two small minaret-like structures, adding to the verticality and prominence of the
        structure.

        <i>
            <h5>Courtyard :</h5>
        </i>
        After entering the gateway, one steps into a large courtyard, which serves as a gathering place for pilgrims,
        especially during Urs and other festivals. The courtyard is paved with stone and marble, offering a clean space
        for prayer and meditation.
        The courtyard is often bustling with activity, where devotees gather to recite prayers, participate in qawwali
        sessions, or offer nazrana (offerings).

        <h4> 3. Exterior and Decoration:</h4>
        <i>
            <h5>Marble Work:</h5>
        </i>
        The Mazar’s exterior is adorned with white marble, which gives it a bright and serene appearance. The marble
        surface is engraved with floral patterns and calligraphy, showcasing the artistry of the time.
        The smooth marble not only enhances the shrine's beauty but also provides a cooling effect, making it a
        comfortable space for visitors during hot days.
        <i>
            <h5>Arches and Jaali Work:</h5>
        </i>
        The Mazar features several arched windows and doorways, reflecting traditional Islamic design. These arches are
        supported by columns, adding a sense of rhythm and structure to the building.
        Some windows are decorated with jaali work (intricately carved stone screens), which allows light to filter
        through while maintaining privacy and a sense of sacredness within the shrine.

        <h4>4. Spiritual Symbolism:</h4>
        <i>
            <h5>Minarets and Dome:</h5>
        </i>
        The dome and minaret-like features represent spiritual ascension, symbolizing the connection between the earthly
        and divine realms. This is a common theme in Sufi architecture, where the structure of the building is designed
        to inspire spiritual reflection.
        <i>
            <h5>Interior Ambiance:</h5>
        </i>
        The interior of the Mazar is a place of tranquility, with soft lighting and the scent of incense creating a
        peaceful atmosphere. Devotees often gather here to recite duas (prayers) and seek blessings.

        <h4>5. Annual Gatherings:</h4>
        The Mazar becomes the center of attention during the Urs of Hazrat Haji Waris Ali Shah, his death anniversary,
        which is celebrated with much devotion. Pilgrims from various parts of India and beyond visit the Mazar to pay
        their respects and participate in the spiritual gatherings.
        During these times, the Mazar and its courtyard are beautifully decorated with lights, and the entire area takes
        on a festive yet deeply spiritual atmosphere, reflecting the legacy of Hazrat Haji Waris Ali Shah and his
        message of love and unity.
        The Mazar of<b>Dewa Sharif</b> stands not only as a religious monument but also as a symbol of Sufi culture,
        offering a space where spiritual seekers can connect with the teachings of love, peace, and universal
        brotherhood.
        Its architecture, with its detailed carvings and serene ambiance, embodies the spirit of Sufism that Hazrat Haji
        Waris Ali Shah spread throughout his life.
