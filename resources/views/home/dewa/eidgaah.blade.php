            <i><b>Eid Prayers :</b></i>
            On the mornings of Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha, the Eidgah fills with worshippers who gather to perform the
            special Salat al-Eid in congregation. This prayer marks the culmination of fasting during Ramadan and the
            beginning of celebrations for both Eid festivals.
            The prayer service at the Eidgah is led by an imam, who delivers a sermon (khutbah) that often emphasizes
            the themes of gratitude, charity, and community solidarity. <br><br>

            <i><b>Community Gatherings :</b></i>
            Beyond being a place for prayer, the Eidgah serves as a venue for social interactions. After the prayer,
            families and friends exchange greetings, share festive meals, and extend well-wishes to one another,
            strengthening social bonds within the community.
            It is a tradition for people to visit the nearby shrine of Hazrat Waris Ali Shah after offering prayers,
            blending the spirit of festivity with spiritual reflection. <br><br>

            <i><b>Charitable Activities :</b></i>
            The Eidgah is also associated with charitable acts, especially during Eid-ul-Fitr, where the giving of Zakat
            al-Fitr (charity given before the Eid prayer) is emphasized. Community members gather to ensure that
            donations reach those in need, allowing everyone to participate in the celebrations.
            On Eid-ul-Adha, many families engage in the ritual of animal sacrifice (qurbani) and share the meat with the
            less fortunate, highlighting the values of generosity and care for the community. <br><br>

            <i><b>Symbol of Unity and Harmony :</b></i>
            The Eidgah of <b>Dewa Sharif</b> stands as a symbol of the town's commitment to unity and peaceful
            coexistence. During Eid prayers, people from diverse backgrounds come together, reflecting the inclusive
            message of Sufism that Dewa Sharif is known for.
            The atmosphere at the Eidgah is one of joy and togetherness, where the spiritual and social aspects of Eid
            intertwine to create a memorable experience for all participants.
            The Eidgah in <b>Dewa Sharif</b> embodies the townâ€™s traditions of spirituality, community, and shared
            celebration. It is a place where the faithful gather in gratitude and unity, making it an integral part of
