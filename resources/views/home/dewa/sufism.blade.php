                <i><b> Sufism</b></i>, also known as Tasawwuf, is the mystical and spiritual dimension of Islam. It
                emphasizes the inward search for God and strives to achieve a personal, intimate connection with the
                Divine through love, devotion, and self-purification. Sufism focuses on the inner meanings of the Quran
                and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad, aiming to transcend materialism and embrace the deeper spiritual
                realities.

            It emphasizes that the external practices of Islam (such as prayer and fasting) should be accompanied by a
            deeper, internal devotion and love for God.
