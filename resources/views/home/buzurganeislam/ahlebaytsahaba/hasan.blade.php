                    <h4>Early Life and Relationship with the Prophet :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Birth :</h5></i>  Imam Hasan was born in Medina in 625 CE (3 AH), three years after the Hijrah (migration to
                    Medina), making him the first grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. His birth brought immense joy to the
                    Prophet, who was very fond of him. Prophet Muhammad gave him the name Hasan, which means "handsome"
                    or "good."

                    <i><h5>Close Bond with the Prophet :</h5></i>  Imam Hasan grew up under the care and guidance of the Prophet, who
                    showed him and his younger brother Husayn exceptional love and affection. The Prophet often
                    emphasized his special place in Islam, referring to Hasan and Husayn as the "leaders of the youth in
                    Paradise." He would frequently carry Hasan on his shoulders, play with him, and pray for his
                    well-being.

                    <h4>Character and Personality :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Virtue and Generosity :</h5></i>  Imam Hasan was known for his incredible generosity, kindness, and patience.
                    His gentle nature and readiness to help others earned him admiration and respect from both
                    companions and people of Medina. He was particularly known for his compassion toward the poor and
                    needy, often giving away his possessions to help those less fortunate.

                    <i><h5>Wisdom and Knowledge :</h5></i>  Imam Hasan inherited both his father’s wisdom and his mother’s piety. He was
                    highly knowledgeable in Islamic teachings and was sought after for guidance on religious and ethical
                    matters. His sayings and insights reflect a deep understanding of Islam and a commitment to living
                    by its values.

                    <h4>Leadership and Caliphate :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Becoming the Caliph :</h5></i>  After the martyrdom of Hazrat Ali (رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ تَعَالَىٰ عَنْهُ) in 661 CE,
                    Imam Hasan was chosen as the caliph by the people of Kufa, who pledged allegiance to him. His
                    caliphate, however, was marked by challenges, as there were ongoing tensions with Muawiya ibn Abi
                    Sufyan, who governed Syria and opposed Imam Hasan’s leadership.

                    <i><h5>Commitment to Peace :</h5></i>  Imam Hasan’s caliphate was short-lived, as he soon faced the threat of civil
                    war. Rather than allow further bloodshed within the Muslim community, he decided to make a peace
                    treaty with Muawiya in order to prevent internal conflict. This decision, though difficult, showed
                    his deep commitment to the unity of Muslims and his preference for peace over violence.
                    According to the terms of the treaty, Imam Hasan agreed to abdicate his claim to the caliphate and
                    retire from political life, with the understanding that Muawiya would not appoint a successor after
                    his death, thereby allowing the Muslim community to choose its leader. This selfless act earned him
                    the title of "Leader of Peace" and cemented his legacy as a peacemaker.

                    <h4>The Treaty and Abdication :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Terms of the Treaty :</h5></i>  The peace treaty stipulated several important conditions, including-
                    Muawiya would rule as caliph but would not appoint a successor, leaving the decision to the Muslim
                    community after his death.
                    The persecution of Imam Ali's supporters (Shia) would cease.
                    Fair treatment of Imam Hasan, his brother Imam Husayn, and the family of the Prophet.

                     <i><h5>Imam Hasan's Sacrifice :</h5></i>  Imam Hasan’s decision to step down from leadership and ensure peace within
                    the Muslim Ummah was a difficult but noble one. He prioritized the welfare of the community over his
                    own position, exemplifying true Islamic leadership by setting aside personal interests for the
                    greater good.

                    <h4>Later Life :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Life After the Treaty :</h5></i>  After abdicating, Imam Hasan retired from political life and moved to Medina,
                    where he lived quietly, teaching, guiding, and dedicating his time to worship and the study of
                    Islam. He remained a respected figure in the community, known for his piety, wisdom, and dedication
                    to the teachings of his grandfather, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

                    <i><h5>Struggles and Patience :</h5></i>  Throughout his life, Imam Hasan faced considerable hardships and challenges,
                    yet he remained patient and steadfast in his faith. He endured attempts on his life, political
                    pressures, and the constant strain of maintaining peace and unity within the Muslim community. His
                    patience and perseverance in the face of adversity are exemplary.
                    Martyrdom

                    <i><h5>Assassination :</h5></i>  Imam Hasan [R.A.] was poisoned, and many accounts suggest that he was poisoned by
                    someone close to him under the influence of his political enemies. He passed away in 670 CE (50 AH)
                    in Medina. His death was a source of deep sorrow for the Muslim community.

                    <i><h5>Burial :</h5></i>  Imam Hasan was buried in the Jannat al-Baqi cemetery in Medina, near other members of the
                    Prophet’s family. His grave became a place of respect and reflection for Muslims, and his legacy of
                    patience, generosity, and wisdom lives on.

                    <i><h5>Sayyid al-Shabab Ahl al-Jannah (Leader of the Youth in Paradise) :</h5></i>  Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) honored
                    him and his brother Husayn with this title, which reflects their purity, virtue, and special place
