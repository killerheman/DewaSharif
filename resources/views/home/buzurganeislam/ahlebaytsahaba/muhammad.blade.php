                <h4>Early Life:</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Birth:</h5>
                </i> Muhammad (PBUH) was born in 570 CE in Mecca, a city in modern-day Saudi Arabia. He belonged to
                the noble Quraysh tribe, specifically the Hashimite clan. His father, Abdullah, died before his birth,
                and his mother, Aminah, passed away when he was six years old. He was then raised by his grandfather,
                Abdul Muttalib, and later by his uncle, Abu Talib.

                <i>
                    <h5>Character:</h5>
                </i> Even before prophethood, Muhammad (PBUH) was known for his honesty, integrity, and
                compassion, earning the titles Al-Amin (the trustworthy) and Al-Sadiq (the truthful). He worked as a
                merchant and gained a reputation for fair dealings.

                <h4>The Revelation:</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>The First Revelation:</h5>
                </i> At the age of 40, while meditating in the Cave of Hira near Mecca, Muhammad (PBUH)
                received the first revelation from Allah through the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel). This event marked the
                beginning of his mission as a prophet. The first revealed verses were from Surah Al-Alaq:
                "Read in the name of your Lord who created—created man from a clinging clot. Read, for your Lord is the
                most Generous—who taught by the pen—taught man what he knew not." (Quran, 96:1-5)

                <i>
                    <h5>Quranic Revelation:</h5>
                </i> The revelations continued for 23 years, forming the Quran, the holy scripture of
                Islam. It addresses spiritual, social, moral, and legal aspects of life, guiding Muslims on how to live
                according to the will of Allah.

                urging people to worship Allah alone and abandon idolatry. After three years, he began to preach
                publicly, which faced strong opposition from the Quraysh leaders, who saw his message as a threat to
                their power and religious traditions.

                </i> The early Muslims endured severe persecution in Mecca. Some were subjected to torture,
                economic boycott, and social ostracism. Despite the hardships, the Prophet (PBUH) remained steadfast,

                period of peace and increased conversions to Islam.

                <h4>Conquest of Mecca:</h4>
                <i>

                Quraysh, Muhammad (PBUH) led a peaceful army of 10,000 Muslims to Mecca. The city was conquered with
                little resistance.

                    <h5>Kaaba Cleansed:</h5>

                restoring it as a place of worship for Allah alone. He declared a general amnesty for his former
                enemies, emphasizing mercy and forgiveness.
