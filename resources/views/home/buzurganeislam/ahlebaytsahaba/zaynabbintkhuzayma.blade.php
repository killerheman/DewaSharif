                Zaynab bint Khuzayma (زينب بنت خزيمة رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ عَنْهَا) was one of the wives of Prophet Muhammad
                (PBUH) and is remembered for her exceptional generosity and compassion. Known as "Umm al-Masakin"
                (Mother of the Poor), she was widely respected for her kindness and charity, often dedicating her
                resources to helping those in need. Although she was only married to the Prophet for a brief time before
                her passing, her legacy of selflessness left a lasting impact.

                    <h4>Early Life and Background :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Lineage and Tribe :</h5></i>  Zaynab was born into the Banu Hilal clan, a branch of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca.
                    Her father, Khuzayma ibn al-Harith, was a respected member of the community.
                    
                    <i><h5>Character :</h5></i>  Even before embracing Islam, Zaynab was known for her compassion, particularly toward the
                    poor and disadvantaged. She would go out of her way to assist the needy, and this attribute earned
                    her the title "Mother of the Poor".
                    
                    <h4>Marriage to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Marriage to the Prophet :</h5></i>  Zaynab’s first two husbands had passed away, leaving her a widow. In 625
                    CE, during the third year of Hijra, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) married her. This marriage showed
                    the Prophet’s care and respect for the vulnerable members of his community, as he often extended
                    support to widows.
                    
                    <i><h5>Short Union :</h5></i>  Tragically, Zaynab passed away within just a few months of her marriage to the Prophet,
                    making her one of the first among his wives to die in Medina. Her time with the Prophet was brief,
                    but she was deeply loved and respected within the household.
                    
                    <h4>Legacy and Character :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Generosity and Charity :</h5></i>  Zaynab bint Khuzayma was remembered for her immense kindness and concern for
                    others. Her commitment to helping the poor left a strong impression on those around her, and her
                    charity work continued to be spoken of even after her death.
                    
                    <i><h5>Compassion for the Poor :</h5></i>  Her actions and concern for the needy inspired the community, reinforcing
                    Islamic principles of charity and compassion. Her legacy is a reminder of the importance of empathy,
                    generosity, and community care in Islam.
                    
                    <h4>Death and Burial :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Passing :</h5></i>  Zaynab passed away just a few months after her marriage to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). She
                    was approximately 30 years old at the time of her death. 
                    
                    <i><h5>Burial :</h5></i>  Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) led her funeral prayer, and she was laid to rest in Jannat al-Baqi
                    in Medina, where many of the Prophet's companions and family members were also buried. <br>
                    <b> bint Khuzayma (رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ عَنْهَا) </b> is remembered as a woman of rare kindness and
                    selflessness. Her dedication to helping others and her place in the Prophet’s family make her an
                    enduring example of compassion and generosity in Islamic history.
