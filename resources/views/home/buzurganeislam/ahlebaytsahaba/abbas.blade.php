                    <h4>Early Life and Background :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Birth and Family :</h5></i>  Abbas was born in Mecca around 566 CE into the prestigious Banu Hashim clan of the
                    Quraysh tribe. His father, Abd al-Muttalib, was a highly respected leader in Mecca and the
                    grandfather of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). This connection placed Abbas in a family that was honored
                    and known for its leadership, courage, and custodianship of the Kaaba.
                    
                    <i><h5>Occupation :</h5></i>  In his early years, Abbas was a successful merchant and engaged in trade. Known for his
                    business acumen, he was one of the wealthiest men in Mecca and often used his resources to help
                    others.
                    
                    <h4>Relationship with Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Support During Early Islam :</h5></i>  Although Abbas did not initially convert to Islam, he had a strong and
                    protective bond with his nephew, Muhammad (PBUH). Even before declaring his faith, he provided both
                    moral and physical support to the Prophet, helping to protect him from harm. This support was
                    evident in incidents like the pledge of Aqabah, where Abbas was present to ensure the Prophet's
                    safety and speak on his behalf.
                    
                     <i><h5>Acceptance of Islam :</h5></i>  Abbas eventually embraced Islam before the conquest of Mecca in 630 CE. He
                    joined the Prophet and the Muslim army on their way to Mecca, marking a significant point of unity
                    for the Banu Hashim family. His conversion strengthened the Muslim community and signaled the
                    growing acceptance of Islam among the Quraysh.
                    
                     <h4>Role in the Muslim Community :</h4>
                     <i><h5>Battle Contributions :</h5></i>  After converting to Islam, Abbas played a crucial role in supporting the
                    Prophet in various battles. During the Battle of Hunayn, he notably stood by the Prophet’s side and
                    called the Muslim forces back to order when they faced a surprise attack, demonstrating his loyalty
                    and courage.
                    
                     <i><h5>Custodian of the Zamzam Well :</h5></i>  As a member of the Banu Hashim family, Abbas held the custodianship of
                    the Zamzam Well, a role of high honor in Meccan society. This position gave him a unique status and
                    respect, as he was responsible for providing water to pilgrims visiting the Kaaba. After accepting
                    Islam, he continued this service, underscoring the connection between his role in Mecca and the
                    importance of serving the Muslim community.
                    
                     <h4>Personal Characteristics and Legacy :</h4>
                     <i><h5>Generosity and Kindness :</h5></i>  Abbas was known for his generous nature, often giving to the poor and
                    helping those in need. His home was a place of hospitality, and he was widely respected for his
                    kindness and sense of responsibility toward the less fortunate.
                    
                     <i><h5>Loyalty to the Prophet :</h5></i>  Throughout his life, Abbas remained loyal to the Prophet. His love for his
                    nephew and his commitment to Islam were evident in his actions and words, making him a respected
                    figure among the Companions.

                     <i><h5>Wise and Diplomatic :</h5></i>  Abbas was known for his wisdom and diplomatic approach, which was beneficial in
                    handling sensitive matters within the Quraysh tribe and among Muslims.
                    
                     <h4>Later Life and Death :</h4>
                     <i><h5>Role in the Caliphate :</h5></i>  After the Prophet’s passing, Abbas continued to play a significant role in
                    the early Muslim community. He advised the Caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman and maintained a

                     <i><h5>Passing :</h5></i>  Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib passed away in 653 CE (32 AH) during the caliphate of Uthman ibn
                    Affan. He was buried in Jannat al-Baqi in Medina, where many prominent figures of Islam are also
