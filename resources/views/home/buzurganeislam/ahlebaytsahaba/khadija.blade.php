                    <h4>Early Life :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Birth and Family Background :</h5></i>  Khadijah was born around 556 CE in Mecca into the prestigious Banu
                    Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. Her father, Khuwaylid ibn Asad, was a wealthy merchant, and her
                    mother, Fatimah bint Za'ra, was also from a noble family. This noble lineage provided her with a
                    prominent social status in Mecca.

                     <i><h5>Marriage and Life Before Islam :</h5></i>  Khadijah was married twice before her union with Muhammad (PBUH).
                    Both marriages ended, leaving her a successful businesswoman. Known for her intelligence and
                    business acumen, she managed a prosperous trading enterprise, earning respect in Meccan society.
                    
                    <h4>Marriage to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) :</h4>
                     <i><h5>Meeting Muhammad :</h5></i>  Khadijah first encountered Muhammad when he was employed to manage her trade
                    caravans. Impressed by his honesty, integrity, and work ethic, she admired him greatly. It is said
                    that she offered him a proposal of marriage, which he accepted.
                    
                    <i><h5>Marriage :</h5></i>  They married around 595 CE when Khadijah was approximately 40 years old and Muhammad was
                    about 25. Their marriage was based on mutual respect, love, and support. Together, they had six
                    children: Zainab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum, Fatimah, Qasim, and Abdullah.
                    
                     <h4>Role in Early Islam :</h4>
                     <i><h5>Support and Encouragement :</h5></i>  When Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) received his first revelation from the Angel
                    Gabriel (Jibril) in the cave of Hira, Khadijah was the first to believe in him. She provided
                    emotional support and reassurance during his initial doubts and fears.
                    
                     <i><h5>First Convert to Islam :</h5></i> Khadijah’s acceptance of Islam marked her as the first Muslim. She stood
                    firmly by the Prophet's side, supporting him both morally and financially, which was crucial during
                    the early years of Islam when he faced immense opposition and hostility from the Quraysh tribe.
                    
                    <i><h5>Protection and Advocacy :</h5></i> Throughout the early period of Islam, Khadijah defended her husband against
                    accusations and slander. She used her social status and wealth to protect him and the nascent Muslim
                    community.

                     <h4>Characteristics and Legacy :</h4>
                     <i><h5>Strength and Resilience :</h5></i> Khadijah is remembered for her resilience, compassion, and strength.
                    Despite the societal pressures and challenges posed by the Quraysh’s opposition to Islam, she
                    remained steadfast and supportive of the Prophet's mission.
                    
                     <i><h5>Charity and Generosity :</h5></i>  Known for her generosity, Khadijah frequently helped the less fortunate. Her
                    charitable acts and support for the community set a precedent for the importance of giving and
                    caring for others in Islam.

                     <i><h5>Role Model for Muslim Women :</h5></i>  Khadijah serves as an exemplary figure for Muslim women, embodying
                    strength, independence, and unwavering faith. Her life illustrates the importance of supporting
                    one’s spouse and standing for justice and truth.
                    
                     <h4>Death and Aftermath :</h4>
                     <i><h5>Death :</h5></i>  Khadijah passed away in 619 CE, just a few years before the Hijrah (migration to Medina). Her
                    death was a significant loss for Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), as she was not only his wife but also his
                    closest confidante and supporter. Her passing occurred during a period known as the Year of Sorrow,
                    as he also lost his uncle Abu Talib, who had been a protector.
                    
                     <i><h5>Impact on the Prophet :</h5></i>  The profound grief felt by the Prophet after Khadijah's death was evident. He
                    often remembered her with love and respect, acknowledging her pivotal role in his life and the early
                    Muslim community. Khadijah’s legacy lived on through their children, especially their daughter
                    Fatimah, who became a significant figure in Islam.
                    
                    <h4>Conclusion :</h4>
                    Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ عَنْهَا) remains a symbol of faith, loyalty, and strength
                    in Islamic history. Her contributions to the early Muslim community and her unwavering support for
