                    <i><h5>Birth and Family Background :</h5></i>  Sawdah was born in Mecca into the Banu Amr clan of the Quraysh tribe.
                    Her father, Zam’ah ibn Qays, was a prominent figure in Meccan society. Sawdah belonged to a
                    respectable family and was known for her intelligence and strong character.
                    
                    <h4>Marriage to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) :</h4>
                    <i><h5>First Marriage :</h5></i>  Before marrying Muhammad (PBUH), Sawdah was initially married to Al-Sakran ibn Amr,
                    a fellow Muslim. The couple embraced Islam during its early days and faced persecution from the
                    Quraysh tribe due to their faith. Tragically, Al-Sakran died, leaving Sawdah a widow.
                    
                    <i><h5>Marriage to Muhammad :</h5></i>  After the death of Khadijah (رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ عَنْهَا), the first wife of the
                    Prophet, Sawdah married Muhammad (PBUH) in 620 CE. She was approximately 55 years old at the time,
                    while the Prophet was around 50. Their marriage provided companionship to the Prophet after the loss
                    of Khadijah and offered Sawdah a supportive role in the Muslim community.
                    
                    <h4>Role in Early Islam :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Supportive Spouse :</h5></i>  As the wife of the Prophet, Sawdah supported him during the challenging early
                    years of Islam. Her presence helped him cope with the hardships and trials faced by the nascent
                    Muslim community.

                    <i><h5>Encouragement and Loyalty :</h5></i>  Sawdah remained loyal to her husband and his mission. She encouraged him
                    in his prophetic duties and played a role in fostering a supportive environment for the family.

                    <i><h5>Compassion and Generosity :</h5></i>  Sawdah was known for her kind and gentle nature. She was compassionate
                    toward others, especially those who were less fortunate or facing hardship. Her character reflected
                    the core values of Islam, promoting kindness and generosity.
                    
                    <i><h5>A Role Model :</h5></i>  Sawdah's life serves as an example for Muslim women, demonstrating the importance of
                    supporting one’s spouse and community. Her loyalty and dedication to her husband and the Islamic
                    cause are qualities that are highly valued in Islamic teachings.
                    
                     <h4>Later Life :</h4>
                     <i><h5>Emigration to Abyssinia :</h5></i>  When the persecution against Muslims intensified in Mecca, many Muslims
                    sought refuge in Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia) during the first migration. Sawdah was among those
                    who initially sought safety outside of Mecca. However, the majority of her life was spent in Medina
                    after the Hijrah (migration) of the Prophet and his followers.
                    
                     <i><h5>Continued Support :</h5></i>  Sawdah continued to support the Prophet’s mission after their migration to
                    Medina. She was involved in the early Muslim community, assisting in various capacities as needed.
                   
                     <h4>Death and Remembrance :</h4>
                     <i><h5>Passing :</h5></i>  Sawdah lived for many years after the Prophet's death, although specific details about her
                    passing are less documented. It is widely believed that she died in 674 CE (56 AH), during the
                    caliphate of Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan.
