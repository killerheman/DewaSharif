                    <h4>Early Life and Background :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Family and Tribe :</h5></i>  Umm Habibah was the daughter of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, a prominent leader of the
                    Quraysh tribe and a powerful figure in Mecca. Abu Sufyan was initially an opponent of Islam and led
                    several campaigns against the Muslims before eventually accepting Islam himself.

                    <i><h5>Marriage to Ubaydullah ibn Jahsh :</h5></i>  Umm Habibah was initially married to Ubaydullah ibn Jahsh, and
                    together they embraced Islam during the early years of the Prophet’s mission. Facing persecution
                    from the Quraysh, she and her husband migrated to Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia), where they sought
                    refuge under the Christian King Negus.

                    <h4>Hardship in Abyssinia and Strength of Faith :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Tragic Loss :</h5></i>  In Abyssinia, Umm Habibah faced one of the most challenging trials of her life when her
                    husband, Ubaydullah, converted to Christianity and subsequently passed away. This left her alone in
                    a foreign land, but despite these difficulties, she remained steadfast in her faith in Islam.

                    <i><h5>Steadfast Faith :</h5></i>  Umm Habibah’s unwavering faith, even in the face of such personal hardship, is a
                    testament to her strong belief and commitment to Islam. She continued practicing Islam alone in
                    Abyssinia, isolated from her family and support system.

                    <h4>Marriage to the Prophet :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Proposal of Marriage :</h5></i>  The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), aware of Umm Habibah’s situation and her
                    dedication to Islam, extended a marriage proposal to her while she was in Abyssinia. The King of
                    Abyssinia, Negus, facilitated the marriage and honored her with a significant dowry on behalf of the
                    Prophet. This marriage not only provided her with support but also symbolized the Prophet’s care and
                    respect for his followers, especially those who had suffered for their faith.

                    <i><h5>Reunion with the Prophet :</h5></i>  After her marriage, Umm Habibah returned to Medina, where she joined the
                    Prophet’s household and became a revered member of his family.

                    <h4>Her Character and Contributions :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Deep Piety and Loyalty :</h5></i>  Umm Habibah was known for her strong devotion to Islam and her loyalty to
                    the Prophet. She was conscientious in her prayers and worship and held a deep commitment to the
                    values of Islam.

                    <i><h5>Wisdom and Prudence :</h5></i>  Umm Habibah was known for her intelligence and discretion. One notable incident
                    that demonstrates her prudence occurred when her father, Abu Sufyan, visited her in Medina while he
                    was still an opponent of Islam. Out of respect for her faith and loyalty to the Prophet, she
                    politely declined to allow him to sit on the Prophet’s mat, showing her unwavering commitment to
                    Islam even over familial ties.

                    <i><h5>Promotion of Family Bonds :</h5></i>  After her father, Abu Sufyan, accepted Islam later in his life, Umm
                    Habibah became a bridge for fostering goodwill between her family and the Muslim community. Her
                    marriage to the Prophet played a role in strengthening the ties between the Quraysh and the Muslims.
                    
                    <h4>Death and Legacy :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Passing :</h5></i>  Umm Habibah lived a devoted life in Medina after the Prophet’s passing. She continued to be
                    a respected figure in the Muslim community, embodying faith and resilience until her death around 44
                    AH (around 664 CE).
                    
                    <i><h5>Burial :</h5></i>  She was buried in Jannat al-Baqi, the cemetery in Medina where many of the Prophet’s family
                    and companions rest. <br>
                    <b>Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan (رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ عَنْهَا)</b> is remembered for her unwavering commitment to
                    Islam, her resilience, and her loyalty to the Prophet. Her life story inspires Muslims to remain
                    steadfast in their faith, to be compassionate and loyal, and to exemplify dignity and wisdom even in
                    challenging situations.
