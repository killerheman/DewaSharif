                Umm Salma bint Abi Umayyah (رَضِيَ اللّٰهُ عَنْهَا), also known as Hind bint Abi Umayyah, was one of
                the most respected wives of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and is considered among the Mothers of the
                Believers. She was known for her wisdom, patience, and loyalty, and played an influential role in the
                early Muslim community.
         
            <h4>Early Life and Background :</h4>
            <i><h5>Family Background :</h5></i>  Umm Salma was born into the prominent Makhzum tribe in Mecca. Her father, Abu Umayyah
            ibn al-Mughira, was a wealthy and respected leader in the Quraysh tribe, known for his generosity and
            nobility. Umm Salma’s family held a high social status and was respected in Meccan society.
            
            <i><h5>First Marriage to Abu Salma :</h5></i>  Umm Salma was initially married to Abu Salma Abdullah ibn Abd al-Asad, a
            close companion of the Prophet and one of the earliest converts to Islam. The couple shared a deep bond, and
            they had four children together- Salma, Umar, Zaynab, and Durra. Abu Salma and Umm Salma were among the
            first Muslims who endured persecution for their faith and migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to escape the
            oppression in Mecca.

            <h4>Conversion to Islam and Migration :</h4>
            <i><h5>Early Conversion :</h5></i>  Both Umm Salma and Abu Salma accepted Islam in its early days, despite the significant
            risk and opposition they faced from the Quraysh. Their dedication to Islam was unwavering.
            
            <i><h5>First Migration to Abyssinia :</h5></i>  Facing severe persecution, Umm Salma and Abu Salma joined a group of Muslims
            who sought refuge in Abyssinia. This migration showed their commitment and willingness to endure hardships
            for their faith.
            
            <i><h5>Migration to Medina :</h5></i>  After returning to Mecca, they later participated in the migration (Hijrah) to Medina,
            the city of the Prophet. This journey was a difficult one for Umm Salma, as she was temporarily separated
            from her husband and son due to opposition from her family. Eventually, after a period of suffering, she was
            reunited with her husband and son in Medina.
            
            <h4>Life with the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) :</h4>
            <i><h5>Marriage to the Prophet :</h5></i>  After her husband, Abu Salma, passed away from wounds sustained in battle, Umm
            Salma was left as a widow with four young children. She was heartbroken over his death. The Prophet
            Muhammad (PBUH), recognizing her devotion, offered her comfort by suggesting a prayer: "O Allah, reward me
            in my affliction and replace it for me with something better." When the Prophet proposed to her, Umm Salma
            initially hesitated due to her age, her children, and her jealousy. The Prophet reassured her, promising to
            care for her children and accepting her wholeheartedly. They were married around 625 CE.
            
            <i><h5>Respected Adviser :</h5></i>  Umm Salma was known for her wisdom and intelligence, and she became a trusted adviser to
            the Prophet. Her counsel was highly valued, particularly during critical events, such as the Treaty of
            Hudaybiyyah. When the Muslims felt disheartened by the treaty’s terms, it was Umm Salma who advised the
            Prophet on how to encourage the companions to fulfill his instructions.
            
            <h4>Character and Qualities :</h4>
            
            <i><h5>Wisdom and Patience :</h5></i>  Umm Salma was highly regarded for her insight and patience. Her strength was evident
            in her resilience through personal hardships, including the loss of her husband and the challenges she faced
            as a single mother before her marriage to the Prophet.
            
            <i><h5>Piety and Knowledge :</h5></i>  She was deeply devout and well-versed in Islamic teachings. Umm Salma is known to have
            narrated numerous hadiths (sayings and actions of the Prophet), and she actively contributed to preserving
            the Prophet’s teachings for future generations. Her narrations cover topics such as faith, prayers, and
            family life.
            
            <i><h5>Advocate for Women’s Rights :</h5></i>  Umm Salma showed keen awareness of issues affecting women and is known for her
            advocacy in addressing women’s concerns. She once asked the Prophet why women were not explicitly mentioned
            in certain revelations. In response, the verse 33:35 of the Quran was revealed, which mentions men and women
            equally in various acts of worship and devotion.
            
            <h4>Legacy and Contribution :</h4>
            <i><h5>Narrator of Hadith :</h5></i>  Umm Salma narrated over 300 hadiths that are preserved in major collections, making her
            one of the prominent female transmitters of hadith. Her knowledge and understanding of Islamic principles
            made her a key figure in preserving Islamic teachings.
            
            <i><h5>Role Model for Muslims :</h5></i>  Her life is a model of faith, resilience, and devotion. She endured numerous trials
            with patience and maintained her faith throughout her life. Her wisdom, compassion, and contributions to
            Islam are honored by Muslims worldwide.

            death. She passed away around 680 CE (62 AH) in Medina. She was buried in Jannat al-Baqi, the cemetery in
            Medina where many other companions and family members of the Prophet are buried.
            Summary
            Umm Salma’s life is marked by profound faith, wisdom, and strength. Her dedication to Islam, her close
            relationship with the Prophet Muhammad, and her contributions to Islamic teachings make her one of the most
            respected women in Islamic history. Her legacy continues to inspire Muslims, particularly women, in their
            faith and daily lives.
