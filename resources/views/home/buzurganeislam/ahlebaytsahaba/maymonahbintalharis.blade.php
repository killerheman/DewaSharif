                    <h4>Early Life and Background :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Family and Tribe :</h5></i>  Maymunah was the daughter of al-Harith ibn Hazn, from the Banu Hilal tribe, an
                    important Arab tribe. Her family was connected to several of the Prophet’s other wives, as she was
                    the half-sister of Umm al-Fadl (the wife of Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib), as well as a close relative
                    of Zaynab bint Khuzayma and Asma bint Umais.
                    
                    <i><h5>Previous Marriages :</h5></i>  Prior to her marriage to the Prophet, Maymunah had been married twice and was
                    widowed each time. She was a respected woman in her tribe and known for her noble character.
                   
                    <h4> Marriage to the Prophet :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Proposal of Marriage :</h5></i>  Maymunah expressed a strong desire to marry the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and
                    her wish was conveyed to him. In 629 CE, while the Prophet was in Mecca for the minor pilgrimage
                    (Umrah) following the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, they married. Her marriage to the Prophet was
                    significant as it brought about closer relations with her tribe and other allied tribes, enhancing
                    unity within the Arabian Peninsula.

                    <i><h5>Divine Blessing :</h5></i>  The Prophet renamed her "Maymunah," which means "blessed," as a sign of the
                    positive impact she would have on the Muslim community.
                    
                    <h4>Her Character and Life with the Prophet :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Piety and Devotion :</h5></i>  Maymunah was known for her deep faith, dedication to prayer, and devotion to
                    Allah. She was a humble and pious woman, often engaging in acts of worship and charity.
                    
                    <i><h5>Loyalty and Compassion :</h5></i>  As a wife, Maymunah was known for her loyalty and gentle nature. She
                    maintained good relations with the Prophet’s other wives, creating an environment of harmony and
                    respect within the Prophet’s household.
                    
                    <i><h5>Supporting Family Unity :</h5></i>  Through her marriage, Maymunah strengthened familial and tribal bonds. Her
                    family ties to other notable figures in Islam, such as her half-sisters and extended family, helped
                    consolidate the relationships between the Prophet’s family and various clans, contributing to the
                    spread and unity of Islam.
                    
                    <h4>Death and Legacy :</h4>
                    <i><h5>Passing :</h5></i>  Maymunah lived several years after the Prophet’s passing and continued to be a respected
                    figure in the community. She spent her later years in Mecca, focusing on worship and charitable
                    works. Maymunah passed away in 51 AH (around 671 CE) at the age of about 80.
                    
                    <i><h5>Burial :</h5></i>  Maymunah was buried in Sarif, a village near Mecca where she and the Prophet had first been
                    married. Her resting place remains known and respected to this day. <br>
                    <b>Maymunah bint al-Harith (رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ عَنْهَا)</b> is remembered for her steadfast faith, kindness,
