                    <h5>Sacred Relic:</h5>
                </b> The shrine's significance stems from its possession of the Moi-e-Muqaddas (the Holy Relic), a hair
                strand believed to be from the Prophet Muhammad. The relic was brought to <b>Kashmir</b> during the 17th
                century by a Kashmiri trader named Syed Abdullah.

                    <h5>Arrival in Kashmir:</h5>

                        Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb</b></i>. It was then kept in the <i><b>Hazratbal Mosque</b></i> for
                safekeeping. The shrine has since become a focal point for Muslim devotion in the region.
