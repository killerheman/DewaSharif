                focuses on preserving traditional Islamic beliefs, particularly devotion to the Prophet Muhammad (peace
                be upon him) and respect for the saints (awliya) of Islam. The movement emphasizes love for the Prophet
                and opposes any practices that are perceived as innovations (bida') in religion.
