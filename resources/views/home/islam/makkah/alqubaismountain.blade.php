        <h4>Islamic Traditions and Events :</h4>
        <i>
            <h5>Miracle of the Splitting of the Moon :</h5>
        </i> According to Islamic tradition, Jabal Abu Qubais is associated
        with the miracle of the splitting of the moon (Shaqq al-Qamar). When the Quraysh challenged Prophet
        Muhammad (peace be upon him) to perform a miracle, he pointed to the moon, which appeared to split into
        two parts. Some traditions suggest that this miracle occurred with the mountain as a witness, making it
        a significant location in this event.

        <i>
            <h5>Safekeeping of the Black Stone :</h5>
        </i> Another tradition holds that before the construction of the Kaaba by
        Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail (Ishmael), the Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad) was believed to
        be kept on Jabal Abu Qubais for safekeeping. When the Kaaba was rebuilt, it was brought back to be
        placed in its eastern corner.

        <i>
            <h5>Connection to Early Meccan History :</h5>
        </i>
        Jabal Abu Qubais is considered one of the first mountains created by Allah, according to some Islamic
        narrations.
        It was historically a site where the Meccans would gather for various announcements, due to its elevated
        position overlooking the Kaaba and the surrounding city.

        <i>
            <h5> Modern Day :</h5>
        </i>
        In recent times, due to the expansion of Masjid Al-Haram and urban development in Mecca, the original
        structure of Jabal Abu Qubais has changed, and much of the mountain has been modified or built upon.
        However, it remains a landmark in the historical and spiritual heritage of Mecca, and many visitors
        reflect on its significance while performing Hajj or Umrah.

        <h4>Spiritual Importance :</h4>
        <i>
            <h5>Symbol of Witness :</h5>
        </i> As a mountain that is believed to have witnessed the miracle of the splitting of the
        moon, Jabal Abu Qubais serves as a symbol of the Prophet’s miracles and the divine signs that affirmed
        his message.

        <i>
            <h5>Connection to Prophethood :</h5>
        </i>The traditions and stories associated with Jabal Abu Qubais reflect the
        divine presence and guidance throughout the history of Mecca and the life of Prophet Muhammad (peace be
        upon him).
        Jabal Abu Qubais stands as a testament to Mecca’s rich spiritual and historical heritage, serving as a
        reminder of key moments in Islamic history and the miracles that occurred near the Kaaba. For Muslims,
        it holds a place of reverence and is part of the rich tapestry of the sacred landmarks that define the
        spiritual landscape of Mecca.
