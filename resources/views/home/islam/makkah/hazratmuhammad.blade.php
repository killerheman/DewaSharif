                Before the Hijrah (migration) to Medina, the life of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in Mecca was
                marked by his early life, prophethood, struggles with the Quraysh, and the spread of Islam. This period
                spans roughly 53 years, from his birth to his migration, and is characterized by significant events that
                laid the foundation for the Islamic message. Here is a detailed account of his life in Mecca before the
                Hijrah.

            <h4>1. Birth and Early Life :</h4>
            <i>
                <h5>Birth :</h5>
            </i> Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born in Mecca in 570 CE, a year known as the Year of the
            Elephant (عام الفيل, 'Aam al-Feel), when the Abyssinian ruler Abraha attempted to attack Mecca with an
            army that included elephants. He was born into the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, a respected
            lineage.

            <i>
                <h5>Orphaned Childhood :</h5>
            </i> His father, Abdullah, passed away before his birth. His mother, Aminah bint Wahb,
            died when he was six years old, leaving him an orphan. He was then raised by his grandfather, Abdul
            Muttalib, and after his death, by his uncle, Abu Talib, who took on the responsibility of caring for
            him.

            <h4>2. Youth and Reputation :</h4>
            <i>
                <h5>Character and Integrity :</h5>
            </i> During his youth, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) earned the titles
            Al-Amin (the trustworthy) and As-Sadiq (the truthful) due to his honesty, trustworthiness, and reliable
            character. These qualities made him well respected among the Meccans, even before his prophethood.

            <i>
                <h5>Trade and Marriage to Khadijah :</h5>
            </i> He worked as a merchant, managing trade caravans. At the age of 25, he
            entered into the service of a wealthy widow named Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, managing her trade. Impressed
            by his integrity and ability, Khadijah proposed marriage to him, and they were married. She remained his
            supportive partner, and their marriage produced several children, including Fatimah (RA).

            <h4>3. Revelation and the Beginning of Prophethood :</h4>
            <i>
                <h5> Retreats in Cave Hira :</h5>
            </i> Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) often retreated to the Cave of Hira in
            the
            mountains surrounding Mecca, where he engaged in meditation and reflection on the state of society
            and
            the nature of existence.

            <i>
                <h5>First Revelation :</h5>
            </i> At the age of 40, during one of his retreats in the cave, he received the first
            revelation from Angel Jibreel (Gabriel) in the year 610 CE. The first words revealed were: “Read in
            the
            name of your Lord who created” (Surah Al-Alaq, 96:1). This event marked the beginning of his
            prophethood.

            <i>
                <h5> Initial Shock and Khadijah’s Support :</h5>
            </i> The experience of the first revelation left him trembling and
            distressed. Upon returning home, he was comforted by Khadijah (RA), who reassured him and took him
            to
            her cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a Christian monk. Waraqah confirmed that Muhammad (peace be upon him)
            had
            been visited by the same angel who came to Moses, signaling his role as a Prophet.

            <h4>4. The Early Message of Islam :</h4>
            <i>
                <h5>Calling to Monotheism :</h5>
            </i> The core of his message was the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid), the rejection
            of idol
            worship, and the call to moral living, charity, justice, and compassion for the less fortunate.

            <i>
                <h5>Private Preaching :</h5>
            </i> Initially, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) spread the message
            privately,
            starting with his close family and friends. His wife Khadijah, his cousin Ali, his close friend
            Abu
            Bakr, and his adopted son Zayd were among the first converts to Islam.

            <i>
                <h5>Gradual Spread of Islam :</h5>
            </i> Over time, a small group of followers, known as the Sahabah
            (Companions), grew,
            and they would secretly gather to learn about the revelations and offer prayers together. The
            House of
            Arqam became a center for teaching and praying during this secretive phase.

            <h4>5. Opposition and Persecution by the Quraysh :</h4>
            <i>
                <h5> Public Preaching and Hostility :</h5>
            </i> After three years of private preaching, Prophet Muhammad
            (peace be upon
            him) was commanded to publicly announce the message. He gathered the Quraysh at Mount Safa
            and called
            them to worship Allah alone and abandon idol worship. This call was met with resistance,
            mockery, and
            hostility from the Quraysh, who saw it as a threat to their social order and economic
            interests.

            <i>
                <h5> Persecution of Early Muslims :</h5>
            </i> The followers of Islam, many of whom were poor, enslaved, or
            marginalized,
            faced severe persecution. They were subjected to torture, boycotts, and humiliation. Notable
            examples
            include the torture of Bilal ibn Rabah, the killing of Sumayyah bint Khabbat (the first
            martyr of
            Islam), and the abuse of Yasir and Ammar.

            <i>
                <h5> Economic and Social Boycott :</h5>
            </i> The Quraysh imposed a boycott on the Banu Hashim clan,
            isolating them
            socially and economically in an attempt to pressure them into abandoning their support for
            the Prophet.
            For three years, the Muslims faced severe hardship and starvation during this time, but they
            remained
            steadfast.

            <h4>6. The Year of Sorrow (Am al-Huzn) :</h4>
            <i>
                <h5> Death of Khadijah and Abu Talib :</h5>
            </i> In the 10th year of Prophethood, the Prophet faced
            immense personal
            loss with the deaths of his beloved wife Khadijah (RA) and his protective uncle Abu
            Talib. This period
            is known as the Year of Sorrow (Am al-Huzn). Khadijah’s loss was particularly painful as
            she had been
            his greatest support, while Abu Talib’s death meant that the Prophet lost his protection
            against the
            Quraysh.

            <i>
                <h5>Increased Hostility :</h5>
            </i> With the death of Abu Talib, the hostility from the Quraysh
            intensified, as they no
            longer feared retribution from his influential uncle. The Prophet and his followers
            faced even greater
            harassment and oppression.

            <h4>7. Journey to Ta'if :</h4>
            <i>
                <h5>Seeking Support :</h5>
            </i> After facing rejection in Mecca, the Prophet (peace be upon him)
            traveled to Ta’if, a
            nearby city, hoping to find support and protection there. However, the leaders of
            Ta'if not only
            rejected his message but also incited the town’s people to mock and stone him.

            <i>
                <h5>Patience and Prayer :</h5>
            </i> Despite the harsh treatment, the Prophet showed patience and
            prayed for the people
            of Ta'if. He sought Allah’s mercy, and it was during this time that Angel Jibreel
            offered to destroy the
            city for its mistreatment, but the Prophet chose to pray for their guidance instead.

            <h4>8. The Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj) :</h4>
            <i>
                <h5> Divine Experience :</h5>
            </i> In 620 CE, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)
            experienced the Isra and Mi'raj,
            a miraculous night journey. He was taken from Masjid al-Haram in Mecca to Masjid
            al-Aqsa in Jerusalem
            and then ascended through the heavens, where he met with earlier Prophets and
            received the command for
            five daily prayers.

            <i>
                <h5>Spiritual Strengthening :</h5>
            </i> This event provided spiritual comfort and strength to
            the Prophet during a time
            of great difficulty, reaffirming his mission and his connection to Allah.

            <h4> 9. The Pledge of Aqaba and Hope for a New Community :</h4>
            <i>
                <h5> Acceptance in Yathrib (Medina) :</h5>
            </i> The Prophet met a group of people from
            Yathrib (later known as Medina)
            who embraced Islam and invited him to their city. They pledged to support
            him and protect him if he
            migrated to Medina. These meetings, known as the Pledges of Aqaba, marked
            the beginning of a new chapter
            for the Muslims.

            <i>
                <h5> Preparation for Migration :</h5>
            </i> The persecution in Mecca and the invitation from
            the people of Yathrib
            prompted the Prophet to instruct his followers to migrate to Medina, where
            they could live and practice
            their faith in peace. The Quraysh became aware of these developments and
            sought to prevent the Prophet’s
            departure.

            <h4>10. The Hijrah (Migration) :</h4>
            The Hijrah (Migration) refers to Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him)
            migration from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE. This event marked a turning point
            in Islamic history, as it signified the beginning of a new Muslim community
            (Ummah) in Medina where they could practice their faith freely. The Quraysh
            of Mecca, threatened by the growing number of Muslims, plotted to
            assassinate the Prophet. He and his close companion Abu Bakr secretly left
            Mecca and traveled to Medina. Upon their arrival, the Prophet was warmly
            welcomed, and the Islamic calendar began from this year, known as 1 AH
            (After Hijrah). The Hijrah is significant for establishing Medina as the
            first Islamic state and fostering a new era of brotherhood and solidarity
            among the Muslims.
