                <h4>Key Aspects of Jabal Al-Noor :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Location and Physical Features :</h5>
                </i>
                Jabal Al-Noor is located about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) northeast of Masjid Al-Haram in Mecca.
                The mountain is about 640 meters (2,100 feet) high, with a steep climb that leads to the Cave of Hira.
                The Cave of Hira is situated near the summit of the mountain and is relatively small, with space to
                accommodate only a few people at a time.

                <i>
                    <h5>Significance of Ghar Hira (Cave of Hira) :</h5>
                </i>
                Ghar Hira is the cave where Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) used to retreat in meditation and
                contemplation, away from the idolatry and social injustice prevalent in Meccan society.
                It is in this cave that, at the age of 40, the Prophet received his first revelation from Allah through
                Jibril (Gabriel). The first revealed verses were from Surah Al-Alaq (Chapter 96: 1-5):
                "Read in the name of your Lord who created—created man from a clinging substance. Read, and your Lord is
                the most Generous—who taught by the pen—taught man that which he knew not."
                This moment marked the beginning of the Quranic revelations and the mission of the Prophet to spread the
                message of monotheism and justice.

                <i>
                    <h5>Importance in Islamic History :</h5>
                </i>
                The event at Jabal Al-Noor is considered the turning point that transformed Prophet Muhammad (peace be
                upon him) from a meditative seeker into the Messenger of Allah.
                The mountain is called the Mountain of Light because it was the place where the light of divine
                revelation first shone upon the Prophet.
                It symbolizes the start of the spread of Islam and the beginning of the Quran's revelation that would
                continue over the next 23 years.

                <i>
                    <h5>Pilgrimage and Visitation :</h5>
                </i>
                Many Muslims visiting Mecca for Hajj or Umrah take the opportunity to visit Jabal Al-Noor and Ghar Hira,
                although it is not a required part of the pilgrimage.
                The climb to the cave is steep and challenging, often taking around 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on
                the climber’s pace.
                Visitors go to reflect on the spiritual significance of the site and to connect with the Prophet’s
                journey and the revelation experience.

                <h4>Spiritual Lessons of Jabal Al-Noor :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Reflection and Contemplation:</h5>
                </i> Jabal Al-Noor represents the importance of seeking knowledge, reflecting
                on one’s purpose, and connecting with Allah. It is a reminder of the Prophet's devotion to seeking the
                truth and his role as a messenger.

                <i>
                    <h5>Divine Guidance :</h5>
                </i> The first revelation at this site emphasizes the value of knowledge and the importance
                of reading and learning in Islam. It serves as a reminder that the Quran is a source of guidance for all
                of humanity.

                <i>
                    <h5>Courage and Perseverance :</h5>
                </i> The experience of the Prophet in the cave and his mission afterward highlight
                the strength and patience required to convey the message of truth, despite opposition.
                Jabal Al-Noor remains a symbol of the beginning of the message of Islam, the spiritual awakening of the
                Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the power of revelation. Its significance is cherished by
                Muslims as a place where the journey of divine guidance began, shaping the course of Islamic history and
                the spiritual path for millions of followers.
