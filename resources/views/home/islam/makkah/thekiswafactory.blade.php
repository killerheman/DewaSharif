                <h4> 1. What is the Kiswa ? </h4>
                The Kiswa is a large, richly embroidered black cloth that covers the Kaaba, the holiest site in Islam,
                located in the Masjid al-Haram (the Grand Mosque of Mecca).
                The cloth is adorned with verses from the Quran, intricately woven in gold and silver threads.
                It is made of the highest quality silk and is replaced annually on the 9th day of Dhu al-Hijjah,
                coinciding with the Day of Arafah during the Hajj pilgrimage.
                The Kiswa is divided into different parts, including a belt (known as Hizam) that runs around the upper
                third of the Kaaba, the burqa (covering of the door), and other sections that cover the corners of the
                Kaaba.

                <h4> 2. History of the Kiswa :</h4>
                The tradition of covering the Kaaba dates back to the time of Prophet Ismail (Ishmael), who is believed
                to have constructed the Kaaba with his father, Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham).
                The practice continued through different periods, including the time of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
                him), and evolved over the centuries with various Islamic caliphates and kingdoms taking on the
                responsibility of providing the Kiswa.
                Historically, the Kiswa was produced in different parts of the Islamic world, including Egypt and Yemen,
                before the establishment of the Kiswa Factory in Mecca, which centralized and standardized its
                production.

                <h4> 3. The Establishment of the Kiswa Factory :</h4>
                The King Abdulaziz Complex for Manufacturing the Kaaba’s Kiswa was established in 1927 (1346 AH) under
                the directive of King Abdulaziz Al Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia.
                The factory was built with the purpose of creating a dedicated facility for producing the Kiswa,
                ensuring that the tradition would continue with the highest standards of quality.
                Located in the Umm Al-Joud area of Mecca, the factory is close to the Grand Mosque, allowing for the
                easy transportation of the Kiswa to the Kaaba.

                <h4> 4. Production Process of the Kiswa :</h4>
                The creation of the Kiswa involves a meticulous and multi-step process, combining traditional artistry
                with modern techniques.

                <i>
                    <h5>1. Weaving the Silk :</h5>
                </i>
                The Kiswa is made from pure silk imported specifically for the purpose. The silk is dyed a deep black
                color before being woven into fabric.
                The weaving process is done using state-of-the-art mechanized looms at the factory, with some portions
                still involving hand weaving for intricate details.

                <i>
                    <h5>2. Dyeing the Silk :</h5>
                </i>
                The silk threads are dyed black for the main body of the Kiswa. In the past, it was also dyed green for
                certain sections, but today, black is the predominant color.
                The dyeing process ensures that the cloth has a rich and even color, appropriate for the reverence of
                the Kaaba.

                <i>
                    <h5>3. Embroidery :</h5>
                </i>
                The embroideries on the Kiswa are some of its most striking features, with Quranic verses beautifully
                embroidered in gold-plated and silver threads.
                Skilled craftsmen use hand-guided embroidery machines to create the intricate Arabic calligraphy on the
                fabric. The main Quranic inscriptions include Surah Al-Ikhlas, Ayat al-Kursi, and other verses that
                reflect the sanctity of the Kaaba.
                The embroidery process is highly labor-intensive, taking several months to complete. The verses are
                written in a specific style of Arabic calligraphy that has been used for centuries.

                <i>
                    <h5>4. Assembling the Kiswa :</h5>
                </i>
                Once the various sections of the Kiswa have been woven, dyed, and embroidered, they are stitched
                together to form a single large cloth. The cloth measures approximately 14 meters high and 47 meters
                long, large enough to cover the entire structure of the Kaaba.
                The Kiswa is made up of five separate pieces: four sides and a fifth piece that serves as the door
                curtain, called Al-Burqa.
                The Hizam, the embroidered band that encircles the upper part of the Kaaba, is attached separately and
                holds special importance as it features intricate Quranic calligraphy and decoration.

                <i>
                    <h5>5. Replacement Ceremony :</h5>
                </i>
                The new Kiswa is installed on the Kaaba every year on the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah, during the Hajj season.
                The old Kiswa is carefully removed, and the new one is draped over the Kaaba.
                The installation of the Kiswa is done with great care by a team of workers and officials. The process
                involves securing the cloth with ropes and carefully adjusting it to ensure that it fits perfectly.
                The old Kiswa is cut into pieces and distributed to various dignitaries, Islamic organizations, and
                museums around the world.

                <h4>5. Materials and Craftsmanship :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Silk :</h5>
                </i> Each year, around 670 kilograms (approximately 1,500 pounds) of pure silk is used for the Kiswa.

                <i>
                    <h5>Gold and Silver Threads :</h5>
                </i> The embroidery requires 120 kilograms of gold-plated and silver-plated threads
                to create the intricate Quranic calligraphy.

                <i>
                    <h5>Skilled Artisans :</h5>
                </i> The factory employs a team of skilled artisans, including weavers, dyers, embroiders,
                and calligraphers, many of whom have specialized training in creating the Kiswa.

                6. Cultural and Spiritual Significance :</h4>
                The Kiswa holds immense religious significance for Muslims worldwide. Its replacement is a reminder of
                the Kaaba's role as the spiritual center of Islam, to which Muslims turn during their daily prayers
                (Salah).
                The black cloth with golden inscriptions symbolizes the reverence and grandeur of the Kaaba, reflecting
                the devotion of the Muslim community towards this sacred site.
                The annual tradition of changing the Kiswa during the Hajj season is also symbolic of the renewal of
                faith and the enduring bond between the Kaaba and the worldwide Muslim community.

                <h4>7. Visiting the Kiswa Factory :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Tours and Educational Programs :</h5>
                </i> The Kiswa Factory offers tours and educational programs for visitors,
                allowing them to witness the production process firsthand. This provides an opportunity for Muslims to
                appreciate the craftsmanship and spiritual devotion that goes into creating the Kiswa.

                <i>
                    <h5>Exhibitions :</h5>
                </i> The factory also has a museum that displays past pieces of the Kiswa, examples of the
                intricate embroidery, and artifacts related to the history of the Kaaba and the Kiswa.

                <h4>8. Preservation of Tradition and Innovation :</h4>
                The Kiswa Factory balances the preservation of traditional methods with modern advancements. While the
                craft of hand-embroidering Quranic verses has been maintained, the factory also utilizes advanced
                machinery to ensure the durability and quality of the Kiswa.
                The complex reflects the Saudi government's commitment to upholding the sanctity of Islamic traditions
                while adapting to the needs of the modern era.
                The Kiswa Factory is more than just a production facility; it is a place where faith, art, and history
                come together. The Kiswa serves as a testament to the devotion of Muslims throughout the centuries and
                represents the timeless connection between believers and the Kaaba. The work done at the factory is a
                beautiful blend of spirituality and craftsmanship, honoring the sacred tradition of covering the Kaaba.
