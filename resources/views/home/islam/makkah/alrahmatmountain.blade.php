                <h4>Significance of Jabal-e-Rahmah :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Site of the Prophet Adam and Hawwa (Eve)'s Reunion :</h5>
                </i>
                According to Islamic tradition, Jabal-e-Rahmah is the place where Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) and
                Hawwa
                (Eve) were reunited after being sent down to Earth from Paradise. After years of separation, they found
                each
                other on this hill, making it a symbol of mercy, forgiveness, and reunion.
                The name "Jabal-e-Rahmah" translates to the "Mountain of Mercy", reflecting the mercy that Allah
                bestowed
                upon Adam and Hawwa by reuniting them.

                <i>
                    <h5> Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) Farewell Sermon :</h5>
                </i>
                The most important event associated with Jabal-e-Rahmah is that it is the location where Prophet
                Muhammad
                (peace be upon him) delivered his Farewell Sermon (Khutbat al-Wada') during his last pilgrimage in 632
                CE
                (10th year of Hijrah).
                In this sermon, the Prophet emphasized key principles of Islamic ethics and social justice, such as the
                sanctity of life, the importance of equality, the rights of women, and adherence to the teachings of the
                Quran and Sunnah.
                This sermon is considered one of the most comprehensive messages about human rights and Islamic
                teachings.

                <i>
                    <h5>Importance During Hajj :</h5>
                </i>
                Jabal-e-Rahmah is located in the plains of Arafat, which is a pivotal site during the Hajj pilgrimage.
                The Day of Arafah (9th of Dhu al-Hijjah) is the most significant day of Hajj, where pilgrims gather in
                Arafat to engage in prayers, repentance, and supplication to Allah, seeking forgiveness for their sins.
                Standing in Arafat is an essential rite of Hajj, and many pilgrims climb Jabal-e-Rahmah as a part of
                their
                spiritual journey, although it is not obligatory to do so. The act symbolizes a connection to the
                Prophet’s
                last sermon and the deep spiritual significance of the day.

                <i>
                    <h5>Physical Description :</h5>
                </i>
                Jabal-e-Rahmah is a small granite hill, approximately 70 meters (230 feet) high.
                At the top of the hill, there is a white pillar, marking the location where Prophet Muhammad (peace be
                upon
                him) is believed to have delivered his farewell address.
                Pilgrims can reach the top of the hill using steps that have been built for easier access.

                <h4>Symbolism of Jabal-e-Rahmah :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Mercy and Forgiveness :</h5>
                </i> It is a place where Muslims reflect on the mercy of Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins. The
                time
                spent here is often considered a chance for spiritual renewal and a reminder of the universal message of
                Islam.

                <i>
                    <h5>Unity and Equality :</h5>
                </i> The gathering of millions of pilgrims from around the world at this site symbolizes the unity of
                the
                Muslim Ummah and the equality of all believers in the eyes of Allah, regardless of their background or
                status.
                Jabal-e-Rahmah holds a cherished place in the hearts of Muslims as a site where mercy, forgiveness, and
                spiritual reflection come together, especially during the culmination of Hajj. It is a place that
                reminds
                pilgrims of the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the profound moments of connection
                to
                Allah and the prophetic traditions.
