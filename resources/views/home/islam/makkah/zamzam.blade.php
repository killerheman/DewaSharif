                During the sacred pilgrimage of Hajj, pilgrims from all over the world are expected not only to follow
                the footsteps of Prophet Ibrahim (AS) but also that of Hajar, the wife of Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and
                mother to Ismail (AS). The miracle of Zamzam water took place in history through Hajar. The Zamzam is
                considered a form of blessed holy water for Muslims globally. It is situated in the Masjid-al-Haram in
                Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is located just a few metres away from the Kaaba, considered the holiest place
                in Islam and visited by millions of Muslims during the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage.

            <h4>History of Zamzam Water :</h4>
            The first instance of Allah’s test of Ibrahim (AS) led to the formation of the well of Zamzam. It all
            started when Ibrahim (AS) faced several hardships during his prophethood that today serve as teachings and
            reminders to humanity about faith, sacrifice, and loyalty to Allah (SWT), among other important Islamic
            principles. These trials include Ibrahim’s (AS) readiness to offer his son Ishaq (AS) as a sacrifice to
            Allah (SWT) and his test of abandoning his son Isma’il (AS) and wife Hajar in the Makkah desert – it is this
            test that provides the basis for Hajj as we know today.
            Upon instructions from Allah (SWT), Prophet Ibrahim (AS) had to leave his wife Hajar and son Ismail (AS),
            with little food and provisions in the ancient Mecca desert. Once the provisions were over, Ismail (AS), an
            infant at that time started crying due to thirst. Hajar in search of water or someone to help fetch water
            ran between the hills of Safa and Marwah to no avail. Defeated, she cries out to God and on returning she
            notices Ismail (AS) striking and scraping the ground with his leg in distress, when suddenly a spring burst
            forth from the barren desert, thus saving both mother and child. This led to the formation of the well of
            Zamzam, a water source so deep in a barren desert that is still in use today.
            On the site of Zam Zam well, Ibrahim (AS) was instructed by Allah to build the Kaaba – the sacred house now
            located in Masjid Al-Haram. After building the Kaba, Prophet Ibrahim would come to Makkah to perform Hajj
            every year, and after his death, this practice was continued by his son Isma’il (AS).

            <h4>Zamzam well – A part of the Hajj Pilgrimage :</h4>
            On the site of Zam Zam well, Ibrahim (AS) was instructed by Allah to build the Kaaba – the sacred house now
            located in Masjid Al-Haram. Prophet Ibrahim would come to Makkah to perform Hajj every year, and after his
            death, this practice was continued by his son Isma’il (AS).

            Thousands of years passed, and the site that was built to commemorate the lessons of Ibrahim’s (AS) trial
            was taken over by pagan Arabs and the worship of idols and spirits. It became a hub for trade due to the
            water source of Zam Zam.

            Thousands of years later, Prophet Muhammad was born in the Quraysh tribe of Makkah and was given a
            revelation and prophethood. As the last messenger of Allah (SWT), Muhammad (PBUH), established Islam in the
            land for mankind – with this came the commandment to restore the Kaaba to its original purpose and resume
            Hajj.

            A visit to the well of Zamzam is now an essential part of the Hajj pilgrimage. During the Hajj, Muslims
            perform a ritual called the Tawaf, where they walk around the Kaaba seven times, drink water from the Zam
            Zam well, and pray.

            Zamzam water is considered to be of utmost religious importance to Muslims all around the world. Its history
            dates back thousands of years. The Zamzam water is believed to be a symbol of purity that has both physical
            and spiritual benefits. In conclusion, it is clear that Zamzam water is an integral part of Islamic culture
            and holds a unique position in the beliefs and traditions of Muslims.
