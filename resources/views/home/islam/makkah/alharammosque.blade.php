                    <h5>Origins :</h5>
                </i> The history of Masjid al-Haram dates back to the time of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son
                Ismail (Ishmael), who constructed the Kaaba. The mosque as it is known today developed over centuries,
                expanding alongside the growing number of pilgrims.

                    <h5>Prophet Muhammad’s Era :</h5>
                </i> During the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), the mosque was a
                simple structure with the Kaaba at its center. After the conquest of Mecca in 630 CE, all idols in and
                around the Kaaba were removed, restoring its status as a place of monotheistic worship.

                of worshippers. The mosque began to take on a more structured architectural form with the addition of
                columns and roofing.

                <i>

                <i>
                    <h5>Saudi Era :</h5>
                </i> Since the establishment of Saudi Arabia, numerous large-scale expansions have taken place,
                particularly from the 20th century onward, transforming the mosque into a massive complex with modern
                amenities.

                The Hajj pilgrimage, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, takes place annually during the Islamic month of
                Dhu al-Hijjah.
                Key rituals of Hajj are performed in and around Masjid al-Haram, such as Tawaf (circling the Kaaba),
                Sa'i (walking between the hills of Safa and Marwah), and drinking Zamzam water.
