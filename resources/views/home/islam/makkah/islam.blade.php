                Islam is one of the world’s major religions, with over 1.9 billion followers globally, known as Muslims.
                It is a monotheistic faith, meaning it believes in one God (Allah in Arabic). Islam is more than a
                religion; it is a way of life, encompassing beliefs, practices, social norms, and laws that guide the
                daily lives of its adherents. Below is a comprehensive overview of Islam, covering its beliefs,
                practices, history, and key aspects.

                <h4>1. Core Beliefs of Islam :</h4>
                The belief system of Islam is founded on the Six Articles of Faith, which include:
                <i><h5>Belief in Allah :</h5></i> The oneness of God, who is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Allah is
                all-powerful, all-knowing, and merciful.

                <i><h5>Belief in Angels :</h5></i> Angels are spiritual beings created by Allah to perform various duties, including
                delivering His messages to the prophets. The angel Jibril (Gabriel) is especially significant for
                conveying revelations to the prophets.

                <i><h5>Belief in the Holy Books :</h5></i> Muslims believe in the divine scriptures revealed by Allah, which include the
                Quran (the final and most important revelation), the Torah (Tawrat), Psalms (Zabur), and the Gospel
                (Injeel).

                <i><h5>Belief in Prophets :</h5></i> Muslims believe in prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity. This includes figures
                like Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and the final prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon them all).

                <i><h5>Belief in the Day of Judgment:</h5></i> There will be a Day of Judgment when all individuals will be resurrected
                and held accountable for their actions in this life, determining their fate in Paradise (Jannah) or Hell
                (Jahannam).

                <i><h5>Belief in Divine Decree (Qadar) :</h5></i> Muslims believe in Allah's preordainment. Everything that happens in
                the universe, whether good or bad, is part of Allah’s plan and knowledge.

                <h4>2. The Five Pillars of Islam :</h4>
                The Five Pillars represent the essential acts of worship that form the foundation of a Muslim's faith
                and practice.

                <i><h5>Shahada (Declaration of Faith) :</h5></i> The statement "La ilaha illallah, Muhammadur Rasulullah"—"There is no
                god but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger"—is a declaration of the oneness of Allah and the
                prophethood of Muhammad.

                <i><h5>Salah (Prayer) :</h5></i> Muslims perform five daily prayers facing the Kaaba in Mecca. These prayers are
                performed at specific times: Fajr (dawn), Dhuhr (noon), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), and Isha
                (night).

                <i><h5>Zakat (Charity) :</h5></i> Muslims are required to give a portion of their wealth (usually 2.5% of their savings)
                to help those in need, which purifies their wealth and supports the community.

                <i><h5>Sawm (Fasting during Ramadan) :</h5></i> During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, abstaining
                from food, drink, and other physical needs. Fasting is a means of self-discipline, spiritual reflection,
                and empathy for the less fortunate.

                <i><h5>Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca) :</h5></i> Muslims who are physically and financially able are required to perform the
                Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. Hajj takes place in the Islamic month of Dhu
                al-Hijjah and involves various rituals that commemorate the actions of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his
                family.

                <h4>3. The Quran and Hadith :</h4>
                <i><h5>The Quran :</h5></i> The Quran is the holy book of Islam and is considered the literal word of Allah. It was
                revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) over 23 years through the angel Jibril (Gabriel). It is
                written in classical Arabic and is divided into 114 chapters (Surahs). The Quran serves as a
                comprehensive guide to life, covering topics like beliefs, worship, ethics, and law.

                <i><h5>The Hadith :</h5></i> Hadith are the sayings, actions, and approvals of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). They
                provide a detailed explanation of the Quran’s teachings and offer practical guidance for implementing
                Islamic principles in everyday life. Major collections include those by Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim.

                <h4>4. Historical Overview of Islam :</h4>
                <i><h5>Origins:</h5></i> Islam began in the 7th century CE in Mecca, in present-day Saudi Arabia. The Prophet Muhammad
                (peace be upon him) received his first revelation in 610 CE at the age of 40, in the Cave of Hira on
                Mount Nur.

                <i><h5>Hijra (Migration to Medina) :</h5></i> In 622 CE, due to persecution, the Prophet and his followers migrated from
                Mecca to Medina. This migration, known as the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar (Hijri
                calendar).

                <i><h5>Expansion of Islam :</h5></i> After establishing a community in Medina, Islam rapidly spread throughout the
                Arabian Peninsula. Within a century after the Prophet’s death in 632 CE, Islam spread to regions in the
                Middle East, North Africa, Spain, Central Asia, and beyond, largely through trade, conquest, and
                missionary efforts.

                <i><h5>Golden Age of Islam :</h5></i> Between the 8th and 13th centuries, the Islamic Golden Age saw advancements in
                science, medicine, mathematics, philosophy, and art. Cities like Baghdad, Córdoba, and Cairo became
                centers of learning and culture.

                <h4>5. Islamic Practices and Ethics :</h4>
                <i><h5>Daily Life :</h5></i> Islamic teachings encompass all aspects of life, guiding Muslims on how to interact with
                others, conduct business, and maintain social justice.

                <i><h5>Family and Society :</h5></i> Family is considered the cornerstone of Muslim society. Islamic teachings emphasize
                respect for parents, care for the elderly, and responsibility towards children.

                <i><h5>Ethical Conduct :</h5></i> Islam emphasizes qualities like honesty, charity, forgiveness, and patience. It
                prohibits harmful behaviors such as lying, stealing, backbiting, and injustice.

                <i><h5>Dietary Laws :</h5></i> Muslims follow dietary guidelines, such as eating halal (permissible) foods and avoiding
                haram (forbidden) items like pork and alcohol.

                <h4>6. Branches of Islam :</h4>
                <b>Islam has various branches, with the two main sects being :</b>
                <i><h5>Sunni Islam :</h5></i> The largest branch, comprising about 85-90% of the Muslim population. Sunnis believe that
                leadership of the Muslim community after the Prophet’s death should be based on consensus.

                <i><h5>Shia Islam :</h5></i> Constituting about 10-15% of Muslims. Shias believe that leadership should have remained
                within the family of the Prophet, specifically through his cousin and son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib.

                <h4>7. Islamic Calendar and Festivals :</h4>
                <h5>Islamic Calendar :</h5> The Islamic calendar is lunar-based and consists of 12 months. Some of the important
                months include.
                <i><h5>Ramadan :</h5></i> The month of fasting.

                <i><h5>Dhu al-Hijjah :</h5></i> The month of Hajj pilgrimage. <br>

                <h5>Islamic Festivals :</h5>
                <i><h5>Eid al-Fitr :</h5></i> Celebrated at the end of Ramadan, marking the conclusion of fasting. It is a time for
                prayer, feasting, and charity.

                <i><h5>Eid al-Adha :</h5></i> Celebrated during the Hajj season, commemorating the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim
                (Abraham) to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to Allah.

                <h4>8. Islam and Peace :</h4>
                The word "Islam" comes from the Arabic root "S-L-M", meaning peace and submission. Islam teaches that
                true peace comes from submission to the will of Allah.
                Muslims are taught to live in harmony with others, uphold justice, and work for the betterment of
                society. The Quran and Hadith emphasize the importance of compassion, kindness, and mercy in
                interactions with all of humanity.

                <i><h5>Conclusion :</h5></i>
                Islam is a faith and a comprehensive way of life, guiding its followers in their spiritual, social,
                ethical, and legal practices. It centers on the worship of Allah, adherence to the teachings of the
                Quran and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and fulfilling the obligations of the Five Pillars. Its
                rich history, profound beliefs, and enduring principles have made it a significant force shaping the
                lives of millions and influencing cultures and civilizations around the world.
