            <h1>Al-Safa ~ Al-Marwa</h1>

            <p>
                Al-Safa and Al-Marwa (الصّفا والمروة) are two small hills situated within the sacred precincts of Masjid
                al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. They play a crucial role in the Islamic pilgrimage rituals of Hajj and
                Umrah through the Sa’i, a ritual of walking between these hills. This practice is a commemoration of
                Hajar (Hagar), the wife of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), and her desperate search for water for her infant
                son Prophet Ismail (Ishmael) in the barren desert.

                <h4>1. Historical and Religious Significance :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Story of Hajar and Ismail :</h5>
                </i> The origin of Al-Safa and Al-Marwa's significance dates back to the story of
                Prophet Ibrahim, who, following Allah's command, left his wife Hajar and their infant son Ismail in the
                desert valley of Mecca. When their water supply ran out, Hajar desperately searched for water to quench
                Ismail’s thirst.

                <i>
                    <h5>Hajar's Search for Water :</h5>
                </i> Hajar ran between the two hills of Al-Safa and Al-Marwa seven times, looking
                for help and a source of water. In her distress, she would ascend each hill to see if she could spot any
                sign of life or water. This act of running back and forth is what Muslims emulate during the Sa’i.

                <i>
                    <h5> The Well of Zamzam :</h5>
                </i> After Hajar's seventh round, Angel Jibril (Gabriel) appeared and struck the ground
                with his wing, causing the Well of Zamzam to gush forth near where Ismail was lying. This well became a
                vital source of water and is considered a miraculous provision from Allah.

                <h4> 2. The Ritual of Sa’i :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5> Definition of Sa’i :</h5>
                </i> Sa’i (سعي) means to strive or make an effort. It is a ritual act of walking briskly
                between the two hills of Al-Safa and Al-Marwa, performed as a part of both Hajj and Umrah. It represents
                Hajar's effort, endurance, and trust in Allah's mercy.

                <i>
                    <h5>Number of Circuits :</h5>
                </i> Pilgrims must walk between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa seven times, starting from Al-Safa
                and ending at Al-Marwa. Each leg, from one hill to the other, counts as one round.

                <i>
                    <h5> Distance :</h5>
                </i> The distance between the two hills is approximately 450 meters (around 1,480 feet), making the
                total distance covered during Sa’i about 3.15 kilometers (around 1.96 miles).

                <i>
                    <h5>Recitations During Sa’i :</h5>
                </i> While performing Sa’i, pilgrims often recite prayers, supplications, and
                praises of Allah. They also reflect on the story of Hajar, her unwavering faith, and Allah's mercy.

                3. Spiritual Lessons of Sa’i :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Faith and Trust in Allah :</h5>
                </i> Sa’i serves as a reminder of Hajar’s unwavering faith in Allah even in the
                face of hardship and uncertainty. Her actions symbolize the importance of striving and perseverance,
                trusting that Allah will provide for His believers.

                <i>
                    <h5>Emulating Prophetic Tradition :</h5>
                </i> The Sa’i is performed following the tradition of Prophet Muhammad (peace
                be upon him), who performed the same act during his Hajj. Thus, it connects pilgrims directly with the
                prophetic tradition and the story of Hajar, creating a deep spiritual connection to the past.

                <i>
                    <h5>A Symbol of Human Effort and Divine Mercy :</h5>
                </i> The act of walking between the hills reflects human effort,
                while the appearance of Zamzam symbolizes divine intervention and mercy, teaching Muslims that they must
                put in effort and trust Allah’s wisdom and timing for the results.

                4. Location and Modern Structure :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>In the Masjid al-Haram :</h5>
                </i> Al-Safa and Al-Marwa are now located within the expanded complex of the Grand
                Mosque in Mecca, making it easier for pilgrims to perform Sa’i indoors, shielded from the heat. The
                passage between the hills is enclosed and air-conditioned.

                <i>
                    <h5>The Sa’i Pathway :</h5>
                </i> The pathway is marked with green lights at specific points, indicating the area where
                Hajar ran quickly between the hills. Men are encouraged to jog between these green markers, while women
                maintain a walking pace.

                <i>
                    <h5>Accessibility :</h5>
                </i> Modern developments have made the Sa’i area wheelchair-accessible and equipped with
                facilities to ensure the safety and comfort of all pilgrims, including those with disabilities.

                5. Qur'anic Reference to Al-Safa and Al-Marwa :</h4>
                The importance of Al-Safa and Al-Marwa is directly mentioned in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:158):
                "Indeed, Al-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever makes Hajj to the House or
                performs Umrah—there is no blame upon him for walking between them. And whoever volunteers good—then
                indeed, Allah is appreciative and Knowing."
                This verse emphasizes that performing Sa’i between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa is a recognized and encouraged
                act of worship, a symbol of faith that connects Muslims to the legacy of Hajar.

                6. Practical Guidelines for Pilgrims :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Sequence in Rituals :</h5>
                </i> Sa’i is performed after Tawaf (the circumambulation around the Kaaba). Pilgrims
                begin at Al-Safa after completing their Tawaf and proceed to Al-Marwa.

                <i>
                    <h5>Supplications at Each Hill :</h5>
                </i> At the beginning of Sa’i, pilgrims face the Kaaba from Al-Safa, raise their
                hands, and make supplications. Many recite the following verse-
                “Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar. La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahul mulk wa lahul
                hamd, wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer.”
                They repeat this at each ascent to Al-Safa and Al-Marwa during the seven circuits.

                <i>
                    <h5>Performing Sa’i with Intention :</h5>
                </i> Like other acts of worship in Hajj and Umrah, Sa’i should be performed
                with the intention (niyyah) of seeking Allah’s pleasure and following the example of the Prophet.

                <h4>7. Symbolic and Spiritual Reflections :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Strength in Desperation :</h5>
                </i> Hajar’s running between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa in search of water highlights her
                strength in desperation and motherly love. It teaches Muslims that even in times of greatest distress,
                turning to Allah and striving for a solution is essential.

                <i>
                    <h5>Divine Response :</h5>
                </i> The sudden appearance of the Zamzam water after Hajar’s struggle is a reminder that
                Allah’s help often comes after sincere effort. It encourages believers to put forth their best effort
                while relying on Allah for success.

                <i>
                    <h5>Unity of the Muslim Ummah :</h5>
                </i> The millions of Muslims who perform Sa’i each year, walking the same path
                Hajar did, demonstrate the unity and solidarity of the Muslim Ummah. It is a powerful reminder of the
                shared faith and history that binds Muslims together, transcending race, nationality, and language.

                <h4>8. Modern-Day Significance of Al-Safa and Al-Marwa :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Continued Legacy :</h5>
                </i> Al-Safa and Al-Marwa continue to serve as a living testament to the faith and
                resilience of Hajar. They remind each pilgrim that their personal struggles and efforts are seen and
                rewarded by Allah, just as He answered Hajar’s plea.

                <i>
                    <h5> Symbol of Spiritual Journey :</h5>
                </i> For many Muslims, the physical journey between these hills symbolizes their
                spiritual journey in life—striving towards Allah’s pleasure, overcoming trials, and trusting in divine
                wisdom.

                <h4>9. Etiquette and Respect :</h4>
                Pilgrims are encouraged to maintain patience and courtesy while performing Sa’i, especially during the
                crowded periods of Hajj when space may be limited.

                <i>
                    <h5>Respect for Rituals :</h5>
                </i> Sa’i is not merely a physical act but a profound spiritual exercise. Therefore,
                pilgrims should approach it with reverence, reflecting on the historical significance and their personal
                connection to the story of Hajar.
                Al-Safa and Al-Marwa stand as enduring symbols of struggle, faith, and divine mercy in Islamic
                tradition. Through the Sa’i, Muslims commemorate Hajar’s unwavering faith in Allah’s mercy, embracing
                the lessons of patience and perseverance. The ritual serves as a powerful reminder that Allah is
                ever-responsive to the pleas of His servants, rewarding those who strive in His path.
