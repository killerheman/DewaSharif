                <h4>Significance in Islam :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Revelation to Prophet Musa (Moses) :</h5>
                </i>
                Mount Al-Toor is particularly significant in Islam because it is the place where Allah (God) spoke
                directly to Prophet Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) and gave him the Torah (Tawrat).
                This encounter between Allah and Musa is a monumental event, highlighting the mountain as a sacred site
                where divine communication took place.

                <i>
                    <h5>Mention in the Quran :</h5>
                </i>
                Mount Al-Toor is mentioned multiple times in the Quran, often in the context of its spiritual importance
                and as a reminder of Allah’s revelations to Prophet Musa. For example:
                In Surah At-Toor (Chapter 52), the mountain is referenced directly in the opening verse: "By the Mount"
                (وَالطُّورِ), underscoring its importance.
                Surah Al-A'raf (Chapter 7) and Surah Maryam (Chapter 19) also mention the story of Prophet Musa's
                encounter with Allah at the mountain.

                <i>
                    <h5>Covenant with the Israelites :</h5>
                </i>
                It is believed that after escaping Pharaoh and crossing the Red Sea, Prophet Musa and the Children of
                Israel arrived at Mount Al-Toor. Here, Musa was commanded to ascend the mountain to receive the Ten
                Commandments and other divine instructions.
                The mountain thus represents the place where Allah made a covenant with the Children of Israel,
                emphasizing obedience to divine laws.

                <h4>Physical Description :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Height and Location :</h5>
                </i> Mount Al-Toor stands about 2,285 meters (7,497 feet) above sea level and is
                situated in the southern Sinai Peninsula.
                The surrounding area is rugged and mountainous, with beautiful vistas of the Sinai desert.
                St. Catherine’s Monastery, an ancient Christian monastery, is located at the base of Mount Sinai,
                marking it as a historical site for multiple faiths.

                <i>
                    <h5>Pilgrimage and Visitors :</h5>
                </i>
                While not a formal part of the Hajj pilgrimage in Islam, Mount Al-Toor is visited by many Muslims who
                seek to connect with its spiritual history and reflect on the profound events that took place there.
                It is also a pilgrimage site for Christians and Jews, who revere the mountain for its biblical
                associations.

                The mountain serves as a reminder of faith, devotion, and obedience to Allah’s commandments.
                It highlights the importance of revelation and the concept of divine guidance in the lives of prophets
                and their communities.
