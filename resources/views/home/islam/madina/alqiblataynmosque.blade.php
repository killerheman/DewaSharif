            <h4>Historical Significance:</h4>
            <i>
                <h5>Change of Qibla:</h5>
            </i>
            The mosque is famous for being the site where the Qibla (the direction of prayer) was changed from
            Jerusalem to the Kaaba in Mecca. This event took place in 624 CE, around 16-17 months after the
            migration (Hijrah) of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to Medina.
            While the Prophet was leading the prayer, he received a revelation directing him to change the Qibla,
            and he turned toward the Kaaba. This pivotal moment is significant in Islamic history.

            <i>
                <h5>Name:</h5>
            </i>
            The name "Qiblatain" literally means "two Qiblas," referring to the mosque's association with both the
            earlier Qibla (Jerusalem) and the later one (Mecca).
