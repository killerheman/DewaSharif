        <h4>History of Medina :</h4>
        <i>
            <h5>Hijrah (Migration from Mecca to Medina) :</h5>
        </i>
        <p>
        In 622 CE, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina, an
        event known as the Hijrah. This marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar (Hijri calendar).
        Medina's ancient name was "Yathrib," but after the Hijrah, it became known as Medina, meaning "The
        Enlightened City."

        <i>
            <h5>The Prophet's Mosque (Al-Masjid an-Nabawi) :</h5>
        </i>
        The most important site in Medina is the Prophet's Mosque, built by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
        him) and his followers. It serves not only as a place of worship but also houses the tomb of the
        Prophet.
        Al-Masjid an-Nabawi is a central place for Islamic followers, attracting millions of visitors each year
        for prayer and spiritual reflection.

        <i>
            <h5>Center of Islam :</h5>
        </i>
        Medina became the center of the first Islamic community, where the first Islamic political system was
        established. It was in this city that the first mosque and community center were built.
        The city was also the center of key early Islamic battles and struggles, such as the battles of Badr,
        Uhud, and Khandaq, which were crucial to the establishment and spread of Islam.

        <h4>Major Religious Sites in Medina :</h4>
        <i>
            <h5>Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (The Prophet's Mosque) :</h5>
        </i>
        This mosque is the heart of Medina and the second holiest mosque in Islam. Every part of it reflects the
        life and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
        The mosque's "Rawdah Sharif" is the place where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is buried,
        making it one of the most sacred sites in Islam.

        <i>
            <h5>Jannat al-Baqi :</h5>
        </i>
        This is a well-known cemetery in Medina, where many members of the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon
        him) family, his companions (Sahaba), and early followers of Islam are buried. It is often referred to
        as "The Garden of Paradise."

        <i>
            <h5>Quba Mosque :</h5>
        </i>
        This is the first mosque in Islam, built by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) upon his arrival in
        Medina. It is located on the outskirts of the city and holds great importance in Islamic history.

        <i>
            <h5>Masjid al-Qiblatain (The Mosque of the Two Qiblas) :</h5>
        </i>
        This mosque is known for being the place where the direction of prayer (Qibla) was changed from
        Jerusalem to Mecca. This event holds significant importance in Islamic history.

        <i>
            <h5>Significance of Medina :</h5>
        </i>
        The word "Medina" means "City" or "City of the Prophet," but it is also associated with "peace" and
        "security." It is considered a place of great spiritual reverence and affection for Muslims.
        During the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, many Muslims visit Medina to pray at Al-Masjid an-Nabawi and to
        pay their respects at the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) tomb.
        The city has been a center of Islamic culture, teachings, and religious scholarship, from which many
        scholars and religious educators have spread their knowledge.
        Medina remains an important center of Islamic faith today, attracting millions of pilgrims annually. Its
        atmosphere is filled with a sense of devotion, love, and brotherhood. The peaceful environment and the
        rich Islamic heritage make Medina a truly unique place.
