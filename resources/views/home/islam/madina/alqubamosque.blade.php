                Masjid Quba holds the distinction of being the first mosque built in Islam. It was established by the
                Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shortly after his arrival in Medina in 622 CE, following the Hijrah
                (migration) from Mecca.

                </i>
                The mosque was built on a plot of land that was donated by two brothers, As'ad ibn Zurara and Sa'ad ibn
                al-Khayr, who were among the early converts to Islam. The Prophet himself participated in its
                construction, marking its importance.
