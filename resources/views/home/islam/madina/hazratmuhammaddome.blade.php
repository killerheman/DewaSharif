                Gumbad-e-Khazra (قبة الخضراء), also known as the Green Dome, is the dome that sits atop the Prophet
                Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) mosque, Masjid al-Nabawi, in Medina, Saudi Arabia. This iconic structure
                is one of the most revered and recognizable landmarks in Islam, as it marks the location of the
                Prophet's tomb, along with the graves of his close companions Abu Bakr as-Siddiq (RA) and Umar ibn
                al-Khattab (RA).

                <h4>1. Historical Background of Masjid al-Nabawi :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Establishment by the Prophet :</h5>
                </i> Masjid al-Nabawi was originally built by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be
                upon him) in the year 622 CE, shortly after his migration (Hijrah) from Mecca to Medina. It served not
                only as a place of worship but also as a center for teaching, community gatherings, and leadership.

                <i>
                    <h5>Prophet’s Residence:</h5>
                </i> The home of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was adjacent to the mosque,
                and after his passing in 632 CE, he was buried in Aisha’s (RA) room, where he had spent his last
                moments. This room was situated next to the mosque, and over time, the mosque expanded to encompass this
                area.


                <h4>2. Construction of the Green Dome :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Early Structure :</h5>
                </i> For the first few centuries after the Prophet’s passing, the area over his tomb
                remained simple and unadorned, in keeping with the Islamic preference for simplicity in graves.

                <i>
                    <h5>First Dome (13th Century):</h5>
                </i> The first dome over the Prophet’s grave was constructed in 1279 CE by the
                Mamluk Sultan Al-Mansur Qalawun. It was made of wood and covered with white tiles. This was intended to
                protect the sacred area from the elements.

                <i>
                    <h5>The Green Dome (16th Century) :</h5>
                </i> The dome was reconstructed and painted green in 1837 CE by the Ottoman
                Sultan Mahmud II, giving it the distinctive green color that it is known for today. Since then, it has
                been called the Green Dome or Gumbad-e-Khazra.

                <h4>3. Religious Significance :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Resting Place of the Prophet :</h5>
                </i> The Green Dome marks the location of the Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon
                him) tomb, making it one of the most significant places in Islam. Muslims from around the world come to
                Masjid al-Nabawi to offer Salam (greetings) to the Prophet.

                <i>
                    <h5>Graves of Abu Bakr and Umar (RA) :</h5>
                </i> To the right of the Prophet’s grave is the resting place of Abu Bakr
                as-Siddiq (RA), the first Caliph of Islam, and next to him is the grave of Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA), the
                second Caliph. They were laid to rest next to the Prophet as per their requests during their lifetimes.

                <h4> 4. Visiting the Green Dome :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Roda or Rawdah (The Garden) :</h5>
                </i> The area between the Prophet’s tomb and his pulpit (minbar) is known as
                Riyad ul-Jannah (Garden of Paradise), also called the Rawdah. It is considered a part of Paradise
                according to the Prophet’s saying- “What is between my house and my pulpit is one of the gardens of
                Paradise” (Sahih al-Bukhari). Pilgrims make an effort to pray in this space when visiting the mosque.
                Offering Salam: When visiting Masjid al-Nabawi, pilgrims approach the Raudhah and offer their greetings
                and Salam to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as well as Abu Bakr (RA) and Umar (RA). This is a
                moment of deep reverence and connection to the Prophet and his companions.

                <i>
                    <h5>Etiquette of Visiting :</h5>
                </i> Visitors are reminded to maintain calm, respect, and silence in this sacred area,
                avoiding any acts of veneration that might go beyond what is prescribed in Islamic teachings.

                <h4>5. Symbolism and Legacy of the Green Dome :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Symbol of Love and Reverence :</h5>
                </i> The Green Dome has become a symbol of the love and reverence Muslims hold
                for the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The sight of the dome is a deeply moving experience for
                many believers, symbolizing the closeness to the Prophet and his teachings.

                <i>
                    <h5>Architectural Heritage :</h5>
                </i> The dome reflects the architectural styles of the Mamluk and Ottoman periods,
                preserving a piece of Islamic history. Its green color and elegant shape make it a distinctive feature
                of Medina’s skyline, visible from many parts of the city.

                <h4>6. Architectural Features :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Green Color :</h5>
                </i> The green paint, applied during the Ottoman period, has since been maintained and has
                become a characteristic feature of the dome. The color green is often associated with life, peace, and
                nature in Islamic culture.

                <i>
                    <h5>Structure :</h5>
                </i> The dome is built on a base of stone and brick, with a wooden frame inside. It has undergone
                multiple renovations over the centuries to ensure its structural integrity and to preserve its
                appearance.

                <h4>7. Importance in Islamic Teachings :</h4>
                <i>
                    <h5>Hadith on Visiting the Prophet's Mosque :</h5>
                </i> The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the
                importance of visiting Masjid al-Nabawi. He said- “One prayer in my mosque is better than a thousand
                prayers anywhere else, except for Masjid al-Haram” (Sahih al-Bukhari). Visiting the mosque, offering
                prayers, and offering Salam at the Green Dome is seen as an act of devotion and love.

                <i>
                    <h5>Unity and Gathering :</h5>
                </i> The Green Dome is a place where Muslims from all over the world gather, regardless
                of their background, language, or nationality. It represents the unity of the Muslim Ummah and their
                shared connection to the Prophet and his message.

                    <h5>Part of Hajj and Umrah :</h5>
                </i> While visiting the Green Dome is not a mandatory part of Hajj or Umrah, it is a
                common practice for pilgrims to visit Medina before or after their pilgrimage to Mecca. The visit allows
                them to pay their respects at the Prophet’s mosque and to reflect on the life and teachings of the
                Prophet.

                <i>
                    <h5>Spiritual Reflection :</h5>
                </i> Standing before the Green Dome, many pilgrims feel a sense of profound connection
                to the history of Islam and to the life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It is a time for
                prayer, supplication, and reflection on the values he embodied, such as mercy, justice, and compassion.

                <h4>9. Preservation and Maintenance :</h4>

                and the Green Dome, including expansions and renovations to accommodate the millions of visitors who
                come to the mosque each year. These efforts are aimed at ensuring that the mosque remains a place of
                worship and reflection for generations to come.

                <i>
                    <h5>Security and Respect :</h5>
                </i> The area around the Prophet’s tomb and the Green Dome is heavily monitored to
                maintain security and ensure that the Islamic guidelines for visiting the site are respected. This
                includes encouraging visitors to focus on prayer rather than engaging in any acts that might contradict
                Islamic teachings about graves.
                The Green Dome or Gumbad-e-Khazra is not only an architectural marvel but also a symbol of spiritual
                devotion and connection to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It serves as a focal point for
                Muslim pilgrims in Medina, offering a space for reflection, prayer, and remembrance of the Prophet’s
                life and legacy. For many, a visit to Masjid al-Nabawi and the sight of the Green Dome is a deeply
                moving experience, representing a connection to the history of Islam and the message of the Prophet.
