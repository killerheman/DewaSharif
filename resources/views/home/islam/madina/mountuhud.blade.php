                </i>
                The most notable event associated with Mount Uhud is the Battle of Uhud, one of the major battles
                between the early Muslims, led by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the Quraysh of Mecca.
                This battle occurred on March 23, 625 CE (3 AH).
                The battle was a response to the Battle of Badr, where the Muslims achieved a significant victory. The
                Quraysh sought revenge, leading to the confrontation at Uhud.

                The battle resulted in heavy losses for the Muslims. Although they initially held the upper hand, a
                group of archers disobeyed the Prophet's orders and left their posts, leading to a counterattack by the
                Quraysh forces. The battle resulted in the martyrdom of many companions of the Prophet, including Hamza
                ibn Abd al-Muttalib, his uncle.
