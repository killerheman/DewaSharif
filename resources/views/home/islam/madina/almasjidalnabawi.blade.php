                The Prophet's Mosque (Arabic: ٱلْمَسْجِد ٱلنَّبَوِي, romanized: al-Masjid al-Nabawī, lit. 'Mosque of the
                Prophet') is the second mosque built by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in Medina, after that of Quba, as
                well as the second largest mosque and holiest site in Islam, after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, in the
                Saudi region of the Hejaz. The mosque is located at the heart of Medina,
                and is a major site of pilgrimage that falls under the purview of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
                Muhammad himself was involved in the construction of the mosque. At the time, the mosque's land belonged
                to two young orphans, Sahl and Suhayl, and when they learned that Muhammad wished to acquire their land
                to erect a mosque, they went to Muhammad and offered the land to him as a gift;
                Muhammad insisted on paying a price for the land because they were orphaned children. The price agreed
                upon was paid by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari,
                who thus became the endower or donor (Arabic: وَاقِف, romanized: wāqif) of the mosque, on behalf or in
                favor of Muhammad. al-Ansari also accommodated Muhammad upon his arrival at Medina in 622.

                Originally an open-air building, the mosque served as a community center, a court of law, and a
                religious school. It contained a raised platform or pulpit (minbar) for the people who taught the Quran
                and for Muhammad to give the Friday sermon (khutbah).
                Subsequent Islamic rulers greatly expanded and decorated the mosque, naming its walls, doors and
                minarets after themselves and their forefathers. After an expansion during the reign of the Umayyad
                caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715),
                it now incorporates the final resting place of Muhammad and the first two Rashidun caliphs Abu Bakr
                (r.a. 632–634) and Umar (r.a. 634–644).
                One of the most notable features of the site is the Green Dome in the south-east corner of the mosque,
                originally Aisha's house, where the tomb of Muhammad is located.
                Many pilgrims who perform the Hajj also go to Medina to visit the Green Dome.
                In 1909, under the reign of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II, it became the first place in the Arabian
                Peninsula to be provided with electrical lights.

            From the 14th century, the mosque was guarded by eunuchs,
            the last remaining guardians were photographed at the request of then-Prince Faisal bin Salman Al Saud,
            and in 2015, only five were left.
            It is generally open regardless of date or time, and has only been closed to visitors once in modern
            times, as Ramadan approached during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

        <h4>History:</h4>
        <i><b>Under Muhammad and the Rashidun (622–660 AD):</b></i><br>
        The mosque was built by Muhammad in 622 AD after his arrival in Medina. Riding a camel called Qaswa, he
        arrived at the place where this mosque was built, which was being used as a burial ground. Refusing to
        accept the land as a gift from the two orphans, Sahl and Suhayl, who owned the land, he bought the land
        which was paid for by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, and it took seven months to complete the construction of the
        mosque. It measured 30.5 m × 35.62 m (100.1 ft × 116.9 ft). The roof which was supported by palm trunks
        was made of beaten clay and palm leaves. It was at a height of 3.60 m (11.8 ft). The three doors of the
        mosque were the Bāb ar-Raḥmah (بَاب ٱلرَّحْمَة, "Gate of the Mercy") to the south, Bāb Jibrīl (بَاب
        جِبْرِيْل, "Gate of Gabriel") to the west, and Bāb an-Nisāʾ (بَاب ٱلنِّسَاء, "Gate of the Women") to the
        east. At this time point in the history of the mosque, the wall of the qiblah was facing north to
        Jerusalem, and the Suffah was along the northern wall. In the year 7 AH, after the Battle of Khaybar, the
        mosque was expanded[12] to 47.32 m (155.2 ft) on each side, and three rows of columns were built beside the
        west wall, which became the place of praying. The mosque remained unaltered during the reign of Abu
        Bakr.
        Umar demolished all the houses around the mosque, except those of Muhammad's wives, to expand it. The
        new mosque's dimensions became 57.49 m × 66.14 m (188.6 ft × 217.0 ft). Sun-dried mud bricks were used to
        construct the walls of the enclosure. Besides strewing pebbles on the floor, the roof's height was increased
        to 5.6 m (18 ft). Umar constructed three more gates for entrance. He also added Al-Buṭayḥah (ٱلْبُطَيْحَة)
        for people to recite poetry.
        The third Rashidun caliph Uthman demolished the mosque in 649. Ten months were spent in building the new
        rectangular shaped mosque whose face was turned towards the Kaaba in Mecca. The new mosque measured 81.40 m
        × 62.58 m (267.1 ft × 205.3 ft). The number of gates as well as their names remained the same. The
        enclosure was made of stones laid in mortar. The palm trunk columns were replaced by stone columns which
        were joined by iron clamps. Teakwood was used in reconstructing the ceiling filza.

        <h4>Architecture:</h4>
        The modern-day mosque is situated on a rectangular plot and is two stories tall. The Ottoman prayer hall,
        which is the oldest part of the mosque, lies towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27
        sliding domes on square bases.
        Holes pierced into the base of each dome illuminate the interior when the domes are closed. The sliding roof
        is closed during the afternoon prayer (Dhuhr) to protect the visitors.
        When the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, they create light wells for the prayer
        hall. At these times,
        the courtyard of the Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns.
        The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer,
        equipped with umbrella tents.
        The sliding domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies were designed by the German Muslim architect
        Mahmoud Bodo Rasch, his firm SL Rasch GmbH, and Buro Happold.\

        <h4> Religious and Cultural Importance:</h4>
        <i><b>Second Holiest Site in Islam:</b></i> <br>
        Masjid an-Nabawi is the second holiest site in Islam after Masjid al-Haram in
        Mecca, and visiting it is an essential part of Umrah and Hajj pilgrimages. Though visiting it is not a
        mandatory part of Hajj, it is highly recommended to offer salah (prayers) and pay respects to the Prophet's
        grave.
        A Place of Spiritual Reflection: Pilgrims come to Masjid an-Nabawi for prayers, reflection, and to seek
        closeness to Allah. The atmosphere in the mosque is one of reverence and spiritual tranquility, offering a
        unique opportunity to connect deeply with the teachings of Islam and the legacy of the Prophet.
